# Mastermind Game Application

This is a game where the computer chooses a secret list of random numbers and the player(s) try/tries to guess the number combinations. At the end of each
attempt to guess the 'n' number combinations, the computer will provide feedback whether the
player had guess a number correctly, or/and a number and digit correctly. A player must guess
the right number combinations within 'm' attempts to win the game.

## Note: 
- n: number of integers to guess
- m: number of attempts available to the players

This game implements REST API to interact with the game and lacks a UI at this moment therefore, you will need to install postman, soapUI or any other software that 
can be used for REST API testing.
